Version 1.0 :

Hello ! Hello !

New Updates :

- Added "PAYPAL" donation button 

- Added "hours" field in CONFIG*** (ps: see explanations under)

- Ecriture d'une fonction de comparaison de fichiers sur la date de modification

*** : 
-Think of setting up your time zone and tell your players to do so
It's necessary for updates, to do so just go to "SETTINGS", tick "I accept"
then in "hours" field put the number corresponding to your server GMT+? 
example : I am in France my server is at GMT+1 so i put 1 into "hours"
then just press ok

- Works with nagtive values too for example put -5 in hours if your server is located in
this timezone !

-GMT zones Image in README FILES folder

Version 0.3a :

Hi ! Major changes for this update !

- Users not allowed to modify all settings anymore...(Anti trolls mode ON :p)

- Now Server Admin has to edit a "client_config.conf" file and put it somewhere on internet,

example : http://ninjaaior.free.fr/client_config.conf (u can have a look at it, i use it for

local tests) and then give this adress to his players or set it manually before distribution

in "file_config.conf" However works well !

- Added warning for editing settings !

- "client_config.conf" stucture In this order, one entry per line :

Update server's adress
Website adress
files to update extensions (separated by a coma, example: pak,exe,html)
EXE to launch name (must be in SAME DIRECTORY as LAUNCHER)
Folder for downloaded files /!\ write none if downloading in same folder as launcher /!\
HEXADECIMAL CODE OF THE MENUS COLOUR
